* Training Scripts
** TODO add scripts that build and save CNN models s.t. they can be used as input for train sequence
** TODO train from serialized model instead defining model locally
*** use 'tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint' callback to save model during training and at the end
** TODO save trained model before ending training script
** META TODO add TODOs from whiteboard at home
** TODO add support for global config file that can be set up once and is passed as single argument to other scripts
*** use pythons builtin configparser combined with the JSON parser as in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/335695/lists-in-configparser
** TODO support for training on KITTI sequences which can and will be used as Reference
** TODO support training of unsupervised models. Since current state-of-the-art research is going in that direction it could be used for comparisons.
